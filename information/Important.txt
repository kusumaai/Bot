ROADMAP

1 - we are currently deep in technical debt we need to get out of through efficient and excellent code.

2 - Audit the entire codebase file by file. It changes often.

3: Stabilize Foundation - Audit, Repair, Format, Comment, Prepare Codebase. Complete critical development

4: Freeze breaking NEW feature development. Concentrate on completing, optimizing and utilizing the codebase we have

5: Implement circuit breaker pattern across all modules

6: Build a more comprehensive pytest framework with meaningful tests

7: Perform a completeness and fit for purpose audit

8: Perform a security audit
