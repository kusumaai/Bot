# KillaBot Status Report

## 1. General Activity Overview

The log covers operations from February 14 to February 16, 2025.

- The bot is running in paper mode, simulating trades without real execution.
- Multiple successful simulated trades were executed, with a starting balance of 10,000 units and a net profit/loss of -10 units.

---

## 2. Critical Errors Identified

- **ATR Calculation Failures (Lines 1-18)**: Repeated errors due to type mismatches between `float` and `Decimal` when calculating ATR (Average True Range).
- **System Initialization Failures (Lines 19, 20, 1026-1033)**: The system failed to initialize due to missing 'config' attribute in `DummyExchangeManager`.
- **Risk Limits Loading Issues (Lines 22, 32, 149, 266, 386, 768)**: Errors loading risk limits, with some instances resolved by using default config values in paper mode.
- **Circuit Breaker Errors (Lines 626-627)**: Async errors related to 'emergency_stop_pct' and `NoneType` objects in `CircuitBreaker`.

---

## 3. Warning Conditions

- **Paper Mode Dependencies (Multiple Lines)**: The bot is forcing initialization success despite errors, which could mask underlying issues.
- **Simulated Trade Performance (Lines 375, 494, 625, 758, 773, 890, 1023)**: Simulated trades show a small net loss, indicating potential issues with the trading strategy or market conditions.

## 6. Recommendations

1. Address the ATR calculation error by ensuring consistent numeric types.
2. Resolve the `DummyExchangeManager` 'config' attribute issue.
3. Fix the `RiskLimits` validation issue.
4. Investigate and resolve Circuit Breaker async errors.
5. Review trading strategy parameters to improve simulated trade performance.
