# ROADMAP

## GOAL1: Get the boat running and eventually become profitable

- Do not assume files or structures. Rely on the codebase and always check.
- Stabilize Foundation - Audit, Repair, Format, Comment, Prepare Codebase. Complete critical development
- Freeze breaking NEW feature development. Concentrate on completing, optimizing, and utilizing the codebase we have
- Perform completeness and fit for purpose audits often
- Perform audits for multiple definitions and overlapping functionality in the code
- Run the bot in simulation/paper mode
- Gather data on the bot's performance
- Complete Training Run

## GOAL2: Evolve GA / ML to bot in running state with models and ga in place

- Implement circuit breaker pattern across all modules
- Build a more comprehensive pytest framework with meaningful tests
- Perform completeness and fit for purpose audits
- Perform a security audit
- Implement a more efficient logging system
- Implement a more efficient error handling system
- Implement a more efficient configuration management system
- Implement a more efficient monitoring system
- Implement a more efficient alerting system
- Implement a frontend monitoring system UI
- Implement a more efficient data storage system
- Implement a more efficient data processing system
- Implement a data visualization system
