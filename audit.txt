Utilize async context managers (async with) for all resource-intensive operations, including database connections and exchange interactions, to ensure proper acquisition and release.
Comprehensive Input Validation:
Implement thorough input validation across all modules to ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities.
Validate not only the presence of required fields but also their data types and value ranges.
Secure Database Interactions:
Ensure all SQL queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.
Implement robust error handling and logging for all database operations without exposing sensitive information.
Cache and Resource Management:
Implement eviction policies or size limits for all caches (data_cache, ratchets, latency_history, etc.) to prevent unbounded memory growth.
Monitor and review cache usage patterns to optimize performance and memory consumption.
Refined Error Handling:
Replace broad exception catches with specific ones to provide clearer error contexts and facilitate debugging.
Sanitize or limit the detail level of logged error messages to prevent leakage of sensitive information.
Security Enhancements:
Conduct thorough security reviews to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, including authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms.
Ensure secure handling and storage of API keys and other sensitive credentials.
Testing and Validation:
Expand the test suite (validation_tests.py) to cover all validation scenarios, including edge cases and failure modes.
Utilize mocking and isolation techniques to ensure tests run reliably without dependencies on external systems.
Documentation and Code Clarity:
Improve code documentation to provide clear explanations of functionalities, especially around complex modules like risk management and ratchet systems.
Refactor code to enhance readability and maintainability, adhering to best practices and coding standards.
By addressing these issues methodically, the trading bot codebase can achieve a more robust, secure, and efficient architecture, ensuring reliable performance in real-world trading scenarios.
