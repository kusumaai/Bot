Roadmap to Resolve Pytest Failures and Errors
Based on the provided pytest output and the associated code snippets, we observe a combination of failures and errors:
Failures: These occur when assertions within tests do not match the expected outcomes, indicating logic or expectation mismatches.
Errors: These stem from exceptions raised during test execution, such as TypeError due to missing parameters or attributes, pointing to issues with function signatures, missing method implementations, or outdated test assumptions.
Below is a detailed roadmap to systematically address and resolve each category of issues, ensuring that the entire test suite passes successfully.

1. Overview and Categorization
The pytest output reveals the following primary issues:
Function Signature Mismatches:
Examples:
generate_ml_signals() missing required positional argument 'ctx'.
ExchangeInterface.__init__() missing required positional arguments 'risk_manager', 'db_queries', etc.
Missing Methods or Attributes:
Classes such as MarketDataValidation and OrderManager lack methods like validate_trade_parameters and store_order.
Logic and Value Mismatches:
Tests fail due to incorrect calculations (e.g., percentage changes) or improper logger configurations.
Mock/Patch Configuration Issues:
Errors related to mock setups, such as incorrect exc_info settings or missing mock attributes.
Decimal Conversion Errors:
decimal.InvalidOperation exceptions indicate issues with Decimal operations.
HealthMonitor Initialization Errors:
HealthMonitor.__init__() receives unexpected keyword arguments like 'db_queries'.

2. Identify and Explain Key Problems
A. Function Signature Mismatches
Issue:
Functions like generate_ml_signals and constructors like ExchangeInterface.__init__ are being called without the required parameters, leading to TypeError.
Cause:
After refactoring, the definitions of these functions/classes have changed, requiring additional parameters that tests have not been updated to provide.
B. Missing Methods or Attributes
Issue:
Classes expected by tests, such as MarketDataValidation and OrderManager, lack certain methods (e.g., validate_trade_parameters, store_order).
Cause:
Incomplete implementation of necessary methods in the codebase or mismatch between the codebase and test expectations.
C. Logic and Value Mismatches
Issue:
Tests fail due to incorrect calculation results or mismatched logger configurations.
Cause:
Errors in the implementation logic or discrepancies between expected and actual values used in assertions.
D. Mock/Patch Configuration Issues
Issue:
Mocks are not properly configured, leading to missing attributes or incorrect parameters being asserted.
Cause:
Outdated or incorrect mock setups that do not accurately reflect the current interfaces of the mocked objects.
E. Decimal Conversion Errors
Issue:
Tests encounter decimal.InvalidOperation due to improper handling of Decimal objects.
Cause:
Incorrect initialization or operations involving Decimal, such as passing non-numeric strings or dividing by zero.
F. HealthMonitor Initialization Errors
Issue:
HealthMonitor.__init__() is receiving unexpected keyword arguments like 'db_queries', causing TypeError.
Cause:
Tests or other parts of the code are passing parameters that the constructor does not expect, likely due to outdated assumptions post-refactoring.

3. Implement Solutions for Each Issue
A. Function Signature Mismatches
Solution:
Update the function definitions to include the missing parameters.

B. Missing Methods or Attributes
Solution:
Ensure that all required methods and attributes are implemented in the codebase.

C. Logic and Value Mismatches
Solution:
Review and update the implementation logic to match the expected behavior.

D. Mock/Patch Configuration Issues
Solution:
Update the mock setups to accurately reflect the current interfaces of the mocked objects.  

E. Decimal Conversion Errors
Solution:
Ensure that Decimal operations are performed correctly and handle potential exceptions.

F. HealthMonitor Initialization Errors
Solution:
Update the initialization logic to match the expected parameters.
